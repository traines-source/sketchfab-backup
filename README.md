# Sketchfab Backup

3D models uploaded to https://sketchfab.com will become unavailable for download sometime. More info:
* https://www.change.org/p/keep-sketchfab-alive-preserve-open-access-to-3d-art-museum-collections
* https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/fab-publishing-portal-open-for-sketchfab-migration/

This project has archived all downloadable Public Domain and [CC](https://creativecommons.org/) licensed models, close to 2 million models or 55 TB. 
The goal is that they can later be reuploaded in one go to another place, without the need for intervention of every individual contributor.

The mirrored data is available here: __https://mirror.traines.eu/sketchfab-backup/__

It will be kept online there at least until there exists another source from which the entire collection can be downloaded. Feel free to browse and download a certain number of models, but please refrain from bulk-downloading everything from the mirror. If you want to mirror a larger part of the collection, please get in touch and I can give you access via SMB/SSH.

The data should move ASAP somewhere else, where they can be properly browsed:

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/ – glb format compatibility is in the works (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Textured_3D)
* https://henge.io/ - another private, but seemingly open platform
* https://3dmr.eu/
* https://kompakkt.de/
* https://polyhaven.com/models
* https://threedscans.com/
* https://3d.si.edu/cc0
* (cf. https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T187844)
* TBD...

For many of these sites, only a subset of the entire collection (e.g. the particularly interesting Cultural Heritage & History category) will be relevant. Still, it would be great to find a site which can be a home to the entire collection. https://archive.org in return at present is not great for browsing 3D data either.
